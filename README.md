# README

## What is this?

This is meant to make our world of Brightshore have a map to better interact with for players and GMs alike. This is maintained here before deployment. Although it's an open-source project based on [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet), this project is a custom operation for I'm Board Games in Middleton, WI

## Project Maturity

We are still working on the best way to mature this project, including dedicated releases, automatic builds for CI/CD, and automated tests, eventually. As always join us on the Brightshore Slack in #leaflet-map to lend us a hand!
